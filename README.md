# Ocaml problems

I came across OCaml yesterday and decided to give it a try, so here are my solutions to the [99 problems](http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html) in OCaml.

I used [ocaml pro](https://try.ocamlpro.com/) to learn the basic of OCaml.

__NOTE__
Solutions present below `(*copied*)` comments are taken from the `99 problem` and the one present above it are my own solution.
